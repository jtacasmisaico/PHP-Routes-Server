This directory contains a series of programs and files
which are used to create a demonstration relational 
database.  This database can be used with the spearfish 
gis data to test and evaluate the grass-informix interface
which is part of the 4.1 release of GRASS. The data in
the relational database represents the Census STF1 files
and the type1 and type7 attribute data for the spearfish
local. Examples showing the use of the dbtools in 
conjunction with this database are provided in the
directory ./dbsql.SAMPLES. In order to use the
programs in this directory to build the sample database
you must have a copy of the INFORMIX database products
SE or On-Line and SQL on your system. In addition your 
environment must be set up to access the INFORMIX binaries.
The environment variable $INFORMIXDIR should be set to
the directory location where the INFORMIX product has been
installed and your $PATH environment variable should include
$INFORMIXDIR/bin. 

To build the sample database run the command mk_tiger. This
program will create and populate the demonstration database
in the current directory. 9 tables will be created:

	stf1_main 20 rows
 
	stf1_person1 20 row(s) loaded.
 			
	stf1_person2 20 row(s) loaded.
 
	stf1_person3 20 row(s) loaded.
 		
	stf1_person4 20 row(s) loaded.	
	 
	stf1_house1 20 row(s) loaded.
	 
	stf1_house2 20 row(s) loaded.
	 
	type1 9139 row(s) loaded.
	 
	type7 56 row(s) loaded.

The total disk space required for the database and the programs
and data needed to build and populate it is approx 4.3 meg. Once
the database has been built and populated remember to modify
the environment variable $DBPATH to reflect the location of the
new database (tiger).
