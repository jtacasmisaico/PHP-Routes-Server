Digital Line Graph data at 1:100,000 purchased

Shows streams and related features

This cell file was generated by patching the streams
from the Spearfish.quad to the streams from the
Deadwood North quad.  The vector files are still separate
and their names are:  streams.spear  and  streams.dead.
They are left separate so the user may practice patching files.
The vector files must first be patched together using Vpatch.
The patched vector file may then be converted to a cell file
using vect.to.cell.
